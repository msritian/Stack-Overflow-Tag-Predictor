If I have my terminology correct, the \"time\" is the total amount of time the page took to respond, and render, and \"latency\" is just the time until the page first received data from the server.</p>\\n\\n<p>So here\\'s the mystery: When I do nothing but write the 10KB of lipsum 100x, my averages are:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00630ms\\nChrome Time: 565.6ms\\nChrome Latency: 28.3ms\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>When I call <code>ob_start()</code> at the very beginning, and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the very end:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00792ms\\nChrome Time: 540ms\\nChrome Latency: 33ms\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>HOWEVER, and here\\'s the mystery - <strong>when I call <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the beginning and end of each 10KB block of text, my Chrome-reported latency spikes by 4x.</strong></p>\\n\\n<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.005814ms\\nChrome Time: 624.7ms\\nChrome Latency: 134.9ms ???\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>As far as I know, the chrome latency should be <strong>cut</strong> by 100x, since I\\'m flushing the buffer 1/100 of the way through the PHP output. I know that the <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> operate on a higher buffer, and they actually flush into a lower buffer, I would expect that lower buffer to flush at the same intervals, meaning I would see about the same latency.</p>\\n\\n<p>My test rig is a very modest Intel ATOM netbook with Nvidia ION graphics, Windows 7 home premium (32-bit) and WAMPserver running Apache 2.2.22 with pretty much default settings. I used Chrome 24.0.1312.52 m.

Would it be individual words or entire phrases/sentences/paragraphs?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>The real world data is about 15 fields including numbers, words, phrases, abbreviations, lists of words, and even paragraphs. They are for something like a library catalog of books and reports and less formal papers and documents.  Some fields and examples follow:</p>\\n\\n<p>Year (e.g. 2010)</p>\\n\\n<p>Season (e.g. fall)</p>\\n\\n<p>First_name (e.g. William)</p>\\n\\n<p>Last_Name (e.g. McShane)  note: would be great to accomodate appostrophes but not necessary e.g. O\\'reilly, can\\'t, Smith-Jenkins.</p>\\n\\n<p>Title (e.g. The economic decline of blah blah regions)</p>\\n\\n<p>Description (e.g. this text addresses a wide range of issues on ... )</p>\\n\\n<p>Classification (e.g. 4AB51-45)</p>\\n\\n<p>Phone (e.g. 555-121-5444)</p>\\n\\n<p>Email (e.g. jkr@ppp.com</p>\\n\\n<p>etc... </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>2. In the design you\\'re looking for, does keyword order still matter? For instance, if field1 = \"I ate a souffle made from lobster\", and I search for \"lobster souffle\", should it work?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m not so concerned with word order or even phrases.  There will likely never be more than 20,000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results.  With one key word though it is impossible.  there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so I can\\'t even search by year without getting a flood of results.  The query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords.  Most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields.  so i might type (2010 economic airlines Florida taxes) and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in Florida or maybe Florida showed up in another field e.g. a Florida based airline, etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sorry for the long winded response.  So, to answer the original question... If you search for \"lobster Souffle\" is should find a record with a Field1 entry of (I ate a souffle made from lobster).  Similary if field one contains (lobster) and field2 contain (souffle) it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>And now two design questions:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Will you ever add a field4, field5, field6, and so on in the future? The reason I\\'m asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate \\'search\\' table or something like that. It\\'s not \\'normalised\\' (if you\\'re not familiar with the term, normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places) but it does make things much more efficient. I can explain that a little more later if you want.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I will almost certainly add / remove fields in the future.  I don\\'t know what normalization is.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>4. I see you\\'re stripping out all characters that aren\\'t alphanumeric (or the space); will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes (like \"wasn\\'t\" or \"O\\'Ryan\"), hyphens, and so forth?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>As mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens.  I only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on YouTube that I got the idea from.  I don\\'t think any search phrases will include words like \"isn\\'t\" but might include authors with appostrophes like O\\'reilly or hyphens like Smith-Galviston.

I\\'ve included the code for the UserService class that is supposed to do the database related stuff. </p>\\n\\n<p>Here is the startup log (including error) in full:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>INFO: Reloading Context with name [/proxi] is completed\\nINFO : com.proxi.controller.HomeController - Welcome home!

This talk though is frankly over my head for where I am at right now, and was wondering if someone could break down what he is meaning by this:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>The easiest source of metadata comes from the HTTP headers. Inside the handleReadFromStream:eventType: method, use CFReadStreamCopyProperty to copy the kCFStreamPropertyHTTPResponseHeader property from the CFReadStreamRef, then you can use CFHTTPMessageCopyAllHeaderFields to copy the header fields out of the response.

It  seeks to eliminate redundancy, removing from a table any attributes (fields) that can be calculated from the other fields. For instance, when you make a reference to another entity, you only store its key. You don\\'t store replicas of attributes from these referred entities, because that would mean having to update them every time you change the referred entity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another situation is an attribute such as height. You want to know the height of a person, but in your application you may like to know it in different units: meters, feet, astronomical units. But you don\\'t store all of these values, you should remove calculated fields, so you only leave one of them (meters, of course), and you calculate the transformed values \"on the fly\", when you need it.</p>\\n\\n<p>You also don\\'t store something like age, you calculate them from date of birth. In this case the fact that age changes with time also plays a role. If you don\\'t do this your data will soon be incorrect, unless you keep updating it constantly.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now suppose you have a social network that displays the astrological sign of each user. For each user we display his or her sign, which is calculated from the date and time of birth, and also from the astrological tradition of the user\\'s choice (e.g. Western or Chinese). Calculating someone\\'s sign is a pretty specialized and involved calculation, but is nevertheless something you can just call from an astrological library and calculate. How would you design this database, would you remove this functionally dependent attribute, or would you calculate the user\\'s sign once, or every time she updates her date of birth, then store it in the database and forget about the possibility of calculating a sign in the rest of your system, or would you enforce the \"3NF\" rule with an iron fist? And how do you see the potential benefit of being able to tweak a user\\'s sign if she insists that her sign should be different from the one that your algorithm is calculating?</p>\\n\\n<p>Now suppose a new application. You are building a system for the Army, that chooses possible occupations for new conscripts. Part of your system is a huge bad-ass pattern recognition machine, developed at ORNL, that tells you what occupations will be allowed for the conscripts, based on a whole lot of data that comes from your database. This pattern recognition method looks at each person\\'s height, date of birth, medical records, school transcript, and it also looks at a long list of answers the person gave to one of two questionnaires. It also takes in consideration evaluation questionnaires filled by higher-rank officers, and the analysis that is made looks at all of the conscripts from each year at the same time, to come up with a bunch of parameters for, say, a feed-forward neural network. This neural network is simpler than the whole of the pattern recognition system, but it is still a pretty involved calculation, not just a temperature unit conversion. Nevertheless, you can see it as a \"black box\", and it can tell you the fate from each of your conscripts when you pull his record form the database.</p>\\n\\n<p>At a specific date in the Army\\'s calendar, the analysis is made, the ANN parameters are found, and now you can run the black box and tell each conscript what he will be doing for the next one year or two. It\\'s a pretty important thing. You will be deciding people\\'s occupations, you will be sending some people to operate ovens at the kitchen, and other to drive tanks. Everyone will be logging in the Army\\'s network to check out their occupations, and see the result in their personal webpages.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, the little black box is there, and it outputs this important value based on the attributes pulled from your database. The attributes and parameters will probably never change, and the calculation of the conscript\\'s destiny will probably be always correct, always the same value form the first day. But would you really leave that outside the database, just to follow the \"remove calculated attributes\" rule?</p>\\n\\n<p>This is not just some calculation of age, astrological sign or temperature conversion. The pattern recognition system is indeed a path to calculate an attribute. But would you really like to keep that inside your system forever, re-calculating this hugely important thing over and over again? Or would you consider it better to calculate everything once, and forget that this magical black box exists? I mean, just run all of this crazy pattern recognition code <em>once</em> some day, then pick the results, and record them in the database. When someone logs in to see the output from his analysis, make it so the query is just a boring data-fetching procedure, and leave all the pettern recognition \"excitement\" for another time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another more palpable situation: You run a web store like Amazon. You have a pattern recognition method to recommend books to people, that is fed from a user\\'s record in your DB. Would you keep running the thing all the time you need the current recommendations, or would you treat the pattern recognition box as something separate from the rest of the system, just feeding its results to the database from where it can be read by other programs?

It\\'s using ChannelFactory and the service contract interface.  Of the ~20 methods in the interface, 2 of them involve Stream (an upload and a download method) so the service side (and currently also the client side) using TransferMode=Streamed.</p>\\n\\n<p>My goal is to include the full HTTP request and response (much like you would see in ethereal/wireshark, or fiddler, or whatever), with headers, in a textbox of the winforms app (just to show what went over the wire)</p>\\n\\n<p>In trying to use the built-in diagnostics (via SvcConfigEditor) and my own (via implementing IClientMessageInspector and then IEndpointBehavior to add the inspector, then channelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add to add the behavior :), I\\'m having 2 issues:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>When doing request.ToString() or reply.ToString() in BeforeSendRequest and AfterReceiveReply, it only gets the \\'body\\' and not the headers.  Digging around in the objects in the debugger it looks like the reply has them in reply.Properties[\"httpResponse\"], but the request\\'s request.Properties[\"httpRequest\"] has an empty Headers property even though Fiddler shows headers for Content-Type, Host, Accept-Encoding, and Connection.  It seems like there\\'s likely a better way to get the \\'raw\\' message that I\\'m missing (and if there\\'s not, someone probably knows an existing chunk of code to \\'reconstruct\\' the raw one from the Message)</li>\\n<li>Since the transfer mode is Streamed, the \\'body\\' part just shows up as the string \\'... stream ...\\', both in SvcTraceViewer (and the \\'raw\\' svclog - even with logEntireMessage=true) and when doing a ToString().  If the mode is Buffered instead, it shows the actual body fine.  I tried making a copy with reply.CreateBufferedCopy(int.MaxValue); but that then caused the actual WCF call to fail with an InvalidOperationException: This message cannot support the operation because it has been copied.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>One fallback would be to move the client to Buffered and just change to StreamedRequest for the one upload call and StreamedResponse for the download call (but I\\'d have to do that programmatically AFAICT, as it\\'s set at the binding level in the config and I don\\'t see anyway of doing it via attributes on the calls), which would take care of the \\'body\\' part and leave me with just the \"get the http request headers\" (issue #1, specifically request.Properties[\"httpRequest\"].Headers being empty) to deal with, but I\\'m hoping there\\'s some way of logging the \\'raw\\' messages without doing so, leaving the TransferMode as Streamed.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks!</p>\\n',\n","  'c# .net wcf rest http-headers'),\n"," (760,\n","  'Clear previous Activities from the widget',\n","  '<p>First i load my application which starts activity A then i go to Activity B.

It has a little step-by-step instruction of how to read the file.\\nAlso using this <a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat%28xls%29Specification.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">xls-file-specification</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\\'m not sure if I even do this step correctly:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>3, Open the Workbook stream and scan for the first instance of a BOF record. This is the beginning of the Globals substream.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>According to the file-specification or this page with a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd908813%28v=office.12%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of the record-numbers</a>, I should be looking for for 2057(0809h) but the whole file doesn\\'t contain that record anywhere(also using a hexa-editor when trying to find it).\\nBut then I read this part on page 20 in the specification:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Byte Swapping Excel BIFF files are transportable across the\\n  MS-DOS/Windows and Apple Macintosh operating systems, among others. To\\n  support transportability, Excel writes BIFF files where the low-order\\n  byte of the word appears first in the file, followed by the highorder\\n  byte.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>If I understand that correctly (not sure that I do) big endian of the words are used, so that what I\\'m looking for is actually 2312(0908h). This makes the impression of being correct as it is found very early in every file i try.</p>\\n\\n<p>So then over to the next step:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>4, Read the Globals substream, loading the BoundSheet8 records and the SST into memory. For more details, see Globals.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>I look for 133(8500h) and it\\'s found shortly after BOF, good. But the problem lies in the two next steps:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>5, From the BoundSheet8 record that corresponds to the substream you want to open, read the first 4 bytes, which contains the lbPlyPos FilePointer.\\n  6, Go to the offset in the stream specified by the lbPlyPos FilePointer. This is the BOF record for the worksheet.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>So the following 4 bytes is a pointer that points to a position in the file I should go to. But reading those bytes in any order gives me a number that is larger than the whole file. And also, this part confuses me: \"This is the BOF record for the worksheet.\" Wasn\\'t that what I found in an earlier step? Hmm...</p>\\n\\n<p>Sorry for my rambling. And I hope I make sense and that someone would be willing to help me a little.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\\nOkay, I\\'ve gotten a little further with this. It\\'s quite confusing to me but it seems that each record is also read as \"big endian\", ie the last variable in the record is the one that is positioned earliest in the file. Though I don\\'t know if it applies to values with variable length? So, looking at <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd773237%28v=office.12%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>, the values of variable length are listed as the last one in a record. But obviously they can\\'t come as the first in the file because there would be no way to know how many bytes to read in if that info comes after it?\\nAnyway, if I ignore this value, and and skip 2 bytes for dt and A/unused and read the following 4 bytes as a uint it turns out as 1130 in my case. Adding that to the pos of the first BOF gives me the exact position of the sheet-BOF. And that cant be a coincidence, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>Now the next problem arises. After that BOF-record the index-record is supposed to follow immediately. But no matter in what way I read in the bytes it still makes no sense...\\nHere\\'s what it looks like:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>09 08 10 00 00 06 10 00 BB 0D CC 07 00 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 00 02 0E\\n  00 00 00 00 00 1E 00 00 00 00 00 12 00 00 00 3E 02 12 00 B6 06 00 00\\n  00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 00 00 00 00 DD\\n  06 0F 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 02 00 02 00 DD 06 0F 00 00 00 00 00\\n  7D 00 0C 00 04 00 04 etc...</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The first 2 bytes there being the BOF record 09 08, or 0809 swapped which is 2057 (which represents BOF) so the rest should be the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd907627.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">INDEX</a> but doesn\\'t make sense...

The system is being developed with Entity Framework 4.1, Code First, MVC3. We are trying to push our team towards unit testing / TDD. It is something that we have not done, but we recognize its value so are taking baby steps in that direction. </p>\\n\\n<p>With all of that in mind, we have decided to build unit tests with Visual Studio 2010\\'s built-in testing framework. We are NOT using the repository pattern or mocks. This is to reduce the complexity and time spent building the unit tests. Each unit test is really more of an integration test - we have a \\'test\\' database that gets initialized each time the tests are run, and each test uses the same controllers that the views use to get as close as we can to real-world behavior of the system.</p>\\n\\n<p>When commenting or answering this question, <em>please do not attack this approach</em>. I am well aware that this is not TDD in its purest form nor is it the ideal pattern for testing units of work. We are doing it this way to get our feet wet with the technology and try to get the most bang for our buck in terms of time spent building the unit tests.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>We are building a lot of unit tests that store an object via a controller, then retrieve the object from the database through the controller to verify that it was stored correctly and that it comes back through our controller the way we would expect. Here is an example:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>[TestMethod]\\npublic void Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid()\\n{   \\n    OperatingCompany opco = new OperatingCompany();\\n    opco.Name = \"OpCo - Edit Post - Valid - DB Save\";\\n    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();\\n    controller.Create(opco);\\n\\n    Guid opcoid = opco.Id;\\n\\n    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();\\n    opco = (OperatingCompany) ((ViewResult)controller.Edit(opcoid)).Model;\\n    opco.Name = \"Edit - OpCo - Edit Post - Valid - DB Save\";\\n\\n    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();\\n    HelperMethods.AddValidationResultsToModelState(opco, controller);\\n    controller.Edit(opco);\\n\\n    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();\\n    ViewResult result = controller.Index();\\n\\n    Assert.IsTrue(((IEnumerable&lt;OperatingCompany&gt;)result.Model).Contains(opco));\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The error we are getting is this: </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Test method WebObjects.Tests.Controllers.OperatingCompanyControllerTest.Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid threw exception: \\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I am pretty sure this is occuring because the entity in question isn\\'t being detached from the context of the first controller, and when we reinstantiate it and try to edit the same entity, it thinks another context still has ahold of it. The reason we are reinstantiating the controller is to ensure that the entity is being pulled back from the database and not just being returned from the cache of the DbContext (please correct me if I am wrong here, but I believe that is what would be happening if we didn\\'t reinstantiate).</p>\\n\\n<p>We were able to get this to work by explicitly detaching every object from the context after every call to SaveChanges as well as detaching when we query objects via the context in our controllers, but I don\\'t want to do that just to get our unit tests to work, plus I am sure it would be a significant performance hit. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Is there some better way to perform this type of integration test with our controllers?</p>\\n',\n","  'asp.net-mvc unit-testing asp.net-mvc-3 tdd ef-code-first'),\n"," (861,\n","  'Does it still make sense to think about effective code on micro scale in C++?',\n","  \"<p>Early in my programming career I was in love with pointer twiddling, lean code, doing everything with as little layers of abstraction as possible and so on.

Note that these are <em>screenshots of a web page</em> (HTMLï¿½+ CSSï¿½+ Latinï¿½Modern fonts for web) and <em>not of a TeX document</em>.  The web page is mostly paragraphs of text, but contains embedded PNG images (rendered TeX snippets) for the formulas involving square roots.

Iï¿½m calculating the baseline by first rendering a snippet consisting of only a ï¿½.ï¿½ character, and then by measuring the height of the resulting image, after cropping away everything below the ï¿½.ï¿½, this tells me how much I need to lower the image (using CSSï¿½s <code>vertical-align</code> style) in order to align it with the surrounding textï¿½s baseline.  This works well for formulas that arenï¿½t too tall.</p>\\n\\n<p>Where it fails is, well, taller formulas, as shown above. In the case of the firstï¿½the largerï¿½square root formula, it needs to be lowered less than normal, because it extends higher than normal.  My calculations for this are currently wrong, and Iï¿½m wondering how I can fix this.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Alternatives?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>What are some ways of measuring the baseline (in pixels) of a snippet?  I canï¿½t really use <code>\\\\documentclass{standalone}</code> for this because it crops the page as tightly as possible, which produces different image heights for <code>$x$</code>, <code>$X$</code>, and <code>\\\\sqrt{x}</code>.  Iï¿½m thinking I may need to render a calibration snippet consisting of two blank lines prior to a lone <code>.</code> (or perhaps a bottom-aligned horizontal rule) instead of just a single <code>.</code> characterï¿½but that seems a bit kludgey.</p>\\n\\n<p>Is there a way to coax TeX into not placing a formula lower on the page when it is taller than standard text?  That is, is there some way I can cause a formula at the top of a page to protrude upward into the top margin?</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>A second problem</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I also noticed that Iï¿½m seeing sub-pixel alignment problems.  Below are screenshots scaled up to 400% actual size:  This formula is ï¿½ pixel too low:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJEjT.png\" alt=\"too low\"></p>\\n\\n<p>At first, I thought I was calculating the <code>vertical-align</code> value wrong, so I manually moved it up by one pixel, but then it turns out that it\\'s ï¿½ pixel too highï¿½which means the problem lies within the image rather than the alignment value:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5KkSK.png\" alt=\"too high\"></p>\\n\\n<p>I suspect this is fixable by making sure I round the image heights up to the nearest multiple of 4 before I downsample them for embedding in the page.  Just wondering if anyone has tackled this problem before, and has any tips.  Iï¿½m encouraged by these results so far, but doing this correctly turns out to be a lot more subtle than I expected it would be.
